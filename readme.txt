= Free Features To Create Your Product Catalogue =

* <strong>Toggle your Catalog Mode - </strong>Enabling the <strong>catalog mode</strong> will let you display all your products in a <strong>product list </strong>while stopping customers from purchasing them at the same time. This will give customers a chance to have visibility over all your ware and inquire about them if interested.

* <strong>Manage Cart and Checkout Option</strong> - Display products even when you are unavailable. Some situations like inventory updates, vacations, or site maintenance can mean that you have a product but are unable to sell them. By cataloging these products you can simply <strong>hide the&ldquo;Add to Cart</strong>&rdquo; button and let customers inquire about them instead.

* <strong>Out of Stock Product Enquiry Option</strong> - Provide your customers with the option to inquire about products even when they are out of stock. With product enquiry, you also get the option to view the list of customers who’ve subscribed to the out-of-stock product. 

* <strong>Add or Hide Product Price</strong> - This WooCommerce product display pluginlets you decide whether you wish to let your customers view the prices of your products or not. Sellers displaying new products can wait for the customer&rsquo;s response before adding a price to the catalogue menu.

* <strong>Customize Enquiry Form -</strong>After <strong>a query form is created, </strong>your <strong>product </strong>inquiry plugin is one of the only <strong>WooCommerce Catalog Plugins</strong>that provide the benefit of inquiry and a catalogue mode. But apart from having an enquiry feature, you can also personalize the inquiry form by simply selecting the options you wish for your<strong> enquiry form</strong>.

* <strong>Include and Exclude Products to Catalog - </strong>Create your personalized <strong>product list</strong> by deciding which products you wish to exclude from your catalog menu.

* <strong>Create Catalog Categories - </strong>Chalk out an entire category of product you wish to catalog online with the exclude category option.

* <strong>Role-Based Catalog Mode</strong>- Turn on the <strong>catalog mode</strong> for only certain users based on the logging status of the consumer. This will also give you the ability to restrict certain users from viewing and buying your products based on their role like author, vendors, etc.

* <strong>Control Query Mails</strong> - Apart from receiving query mails in your wordpress related account you can also add any other email address where you would be comfortable answering customer queries.

* <strong>Catalog Button Customizer- </strong>You can design and recreate the catalogue button however you please. Along with it, you can add an extra function to it like a redirect link.

* <strong>Additional CSS</strong> - You can also jazz up your enquiry button by adding a CSS code to personalise it further. This way your enquiry button will match the theme of your marketplace.

= WooCommerce Request a Quote & Advance with Product Catalog =
By going pro with product catalog you are not just availing the benefits of pro features offered by MultiVendorX with also giving your customers an experience they would never forget. Here is a list of pro features you would get with Product Catalogue.

* <strong>Enable both Catalog and Sale Mode - </strong>Boost up your sales by activating both <strong>catalog and sale mode </strong>together. This way you give your customers the option to inquire about a purchase and buy it only when certain.

* <strong>Manage Price Visibility -</strong>For items appearing on the catalog, Admin can decide to either hide or display the price of the product. In some cases, they can even replace prices with informative texts like &lsquo;contact vendor&rsquo; or &lsquo;coming soon&rsquo; and so on.

* <strong>Allot Product Enquiry Cart - </strong>Having a <strong>product enquiry cart</strong> would give the customers the option of making<strong> multiple queries about multiple products</strong> at the same time. This will not only save time but also provide a good shopping experience.

* <strong>In-Built Query Management System - </strong>Upgrading to<strong> Advanced mode</strong> will give you the advantage of managing all your queries in real-time with an in-built query management system. But that is just one side of the coin, the inbuilt query manager also stores all your queries and answers which can later be used by you for evaluation.

* <strong>Complete Customization of Enquiry Form - </strong>Customising your <strong>product enquiry form</strong> is a benefit you can get with both Product Catalogue Enquiry and  WooCommerce request a quote & Product Catalog. But the difference is that, unlike the free version where you select questions relevant to a query in the <strong>enquiry pro</strong> version you can customize the form by adding a form field and designing the form at your convenience.

* <strong>Manage and Customise Query Mails -</strong> With the help of the Pro version, you can design<strong> inquiry emails </strong>using our<strong> mails templates. </strong>Apart from this, you can send query mail to both customers and vendors after a query form is created.

* <strong>Make it Marketplace Ready - </strong>Unlike the free version, the pro version is more apt for your marketplace as it allows you to accept multiple queries from customers irrespective of the product seller.
